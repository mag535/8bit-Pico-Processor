Shared Project Library  
/home/ECE472_572/8bitPicoProcessor

For now whenever you make a new file in the shared library you need to go to the command line and run these commands for the cell view.  

`chmod -R 770 <cell name>`  
`chgrp -R ECE472_572 ./<cell name>`

## Standards

1. All variables in Cadence Virtuoso must be capitalized
2. The clock variable is spelled `CLK`
3. Only use the OSU library for standard cells
4. Use 2's Complement for ALU (Professor's note)
